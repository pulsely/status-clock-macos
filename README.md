# Status Clock for macOS

Status Clock shows an additional clock on your macOS status bar, with the time zone of your choice.

You can enable and disable the seconds as necessary.

## Re-written in SwiftUI

The first version of Status Clock was written in Objective C. The code is now rewritten in SwiftUI.

While there is a new "MenuBarExtra" that can be used under SwiftUI, the variable width of the menu item would jump. Therefore, AppKit API is used for the time being for display a fixed width for the case of "showing seconds".
